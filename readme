1. what is the motive of this project ?
    This project integrated the GraphqlApi client in .net core 3.1. I am not going to used any design pattern, bcz that's not the scope of this project


2. The nuget package used in the project are listed below
  1.GraphQL.Client
  2.GraphQL.Client.Serializer.Newtonsoft

3. Hasura graphql api is used

4. Role based authentication in hasura is also coverd in this project
   To see that check GraphqlClientBase.cs file where we are passing required authentication as request header
    
    var defaultHeader = httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders;
            defaultHeader.Add("X-Hasura-Role", "tenantuser");
            defaultHeader.Add("X-Hasura-Tenant-Id", "zyxv-abcd");
